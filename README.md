# Project Brief 
- I was required to code along with the lecturer from this lesson: [VanLife Project Bootstrapping](https://scrimba.com/learn/react/vanlife-project-bootstrapping-co8bc40b191eec875ecf00b23). The starter code had all the CSS styling required for the project; I had to just link the corresponding classes as I code along. 

The focus for this project will be to understand routing and present your code. Along with your code, you will need to submit a recorded presentation talking through the presentation points included below.

# Project Overview

## React Routing Presentation Talking Points

For your recorded presentation, you will be discussing key concepts related to React Router, an essential tool for building single-page applications. To illustrate your understanding, address the following three questions in your presentation. These questions are designed to test your knowledge of the content from the "Advanced React Routing" Van Life Project, including setup, functionality, and application of React Router.

### Question 1: Explain the Setup and Basic Configuration of React Router

**Key Points to Cover:**
- What is the purpose of using React Router in a React application?
- How do you set up React Router using `BrowserRouter` as shown in the lessons?
- Describe the role of the `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components in defining the navigation structure.

### Question 2: Application of Route Parameters and Nested Routes

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Explain what route parameters are and how they are used in React Router, including the use of `useParams()` to access these parameters.
- Discuss the concept of nested routes as introduced in the lessons. What are nested routes, and how do they benefit the structure of a React application?
- Provide an example, such as the configuration for nested routes in the VanLife project.

### Question 3: Implementation of Navigation Controls and Dynamic Linking

**Key Points to Cover:**
- How does the `<Link>` component enhance navigation within a React application?
- Describe the use of `NavLink` for active styling. What makes `NavLink` different from the basic `Link` component?
- Discuss the use of search parameters and the `useSearchParams` hook to dynamically filter content, as seen in the VanLife project challenges.

Be prepared to provide code snippets and real-world application examples from your Van Life Project to support your explanations.

# Elements Included
- API
- React icons & Firebase dependencies
- Bootstrap 
- CSS Styling
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useParams, useSearchParams)
- React Router Hooks (useNavigate, useLocation)
- React Router Components (BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link, NavLink)

# Reflections

## Areas of Mastery 
- I was able to successfully set up React Router and implement routing in my application even though it took a lot of time.
- I gained a good understanding of route parameters and nested routes, which helped me to structure my application in a more organized way.

## Challenges Faced
- I faced some challenges while implementing navigation controls and dynamic linking, but I was able to overcome them with the help of my peers and online resources.
- Installing missing dependencies to get my application to work.

## Areas of Improvement
- I need to improve my understanding of search parameters and the useSearchParams hook, as I found it a bit tricky to implement.
- I would like to explore more advanced features of React Router, such as route protection and authentication.

# Overall Learning Experiences
- This project helped me to gain a deeper understanding of React Router and its applications in building single-page applications. I learned how to effectively use React Router to create a well-structured and navigable application. I realized the importance of practice and patience while learning new concepts in React.
